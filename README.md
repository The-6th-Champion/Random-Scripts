# Random Scripts

You ever make a script to do something that you would rather not do manually? Like for math, or writing something repeatedly? Did you ever want to share this file, but dismissed the idea, thinking it wasn't worth the trouble? If yes, you are in the right place. If no, doesn't matter, you still are in the right place.

This is a collection of absolutely random scripts that makle life easier (or more fun). You are welcome to submit your own here. Use the format below â¬‡

```ini
[Folder] # project folder; No spaces, use hyphens, capitalize first letter only
    README.md # Readme
    [Scripts, Assets, etc] # all other files. all languages welcome!

# Make file and folder names meaningful, but as short as psosible
# you dont need ot only have one Script per project folder, the Example below shows multiple files made by the same user, with related abilities

EX:

Sequence-equations # Folder name
    README.md # Readme
    geometric.py # All the files.
    arithmetic.py
    explicit_sub.py
```

README format:

```md
# Full Title
## About

any info of what it does in a nutshell, any notes, how to use it, etc, all goes here.

## Table Of Contents
1. file 1 - main use of this file
2. file 2 - main use of this file
<!-- do this no matter your file count-->

Good Luck and have fun!

##### BTW, you dont need to compile your scripts if they are a language that uses it, but it is appreciated if you do. I may add other functionalities for built projects later.
